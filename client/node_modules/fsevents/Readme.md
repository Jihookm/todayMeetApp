Native access to OS X FSEvents in [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)

The FSEvents API in OS X allows applications to register for notifications of
changes to a given directory tree. It is a very fast and lightweight alternative
to kqueue.

This is a low-level library. For a cross-compatible file watching module that
uses fsevents, check out [Chokidar](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chokidar).

## Installation

## Usage

```js

=======
>>>>>>> 3aa3ad78 (re)
var fsevents = require('fsevents');
var watcher = fsevents(__dirname);
watcher.on('fsevent', function(path, flags, id) { }); // RAW Event as emitted by OS-X
watcher.on('change', function(path, info) { }); // Common Event for all changes
watcher.start() // To start observation
watcher.stop()  // To end observation
<<<<<<< HEAD
```

### Events

 * *fsevent* - RAW Event as emitted by OS-X
 * *change* - Common Event for all changes
 * *created* - A File-System-Item has been created
 * *deleted* - A File-System-Item has been deleted
 * *modified* - A File-System-Item has been modified
 * *moved-out* - A File-System-Item has been moved away from this location
 * *moved-in* - A File-System-Item has been moved into this location

All events except *fsevent* take an *info* object as the second parameter of the callback. The structure of this object is:

```js
{
  "event": "<event-type>",
  "id": <eventi-id>,
  "path": "<path-that-this-is-about>",
  "type": "<file|directory|symlink>",
  "changes": {
    "inode": true, // Has the iNode Meta-Information changed
    "finder": false, // Has the Finder Meta-Data changed
    "access": false, // Have the access permissions changed
    "xattrs": false // Have the xAttributes changed
  },
  "flags": <raw-flags>
}
```
