<<<<<<< HEAD
Native access to OS X FSEvents in [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)

The FSEvents API in OS X allows applications to register for notifications of
changes to a given directory tree. It is a very fast and lightweight alternative
to kqueue.

This is a low-level library. For a cross-compatible file watching module that
uses fsevents, check out [Chokidar](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chokidar).

## Installation

	$ npm install fsevents

Native access to MacOS FSEvents in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

The FSEvents API in MacOS allows applications to register for notifications of
changes to a given directory tree. It is a very fast and lightweight alternative
to kqueue.

This is a low-level library. For a cross-platform file watching module that
uses fsevents, check out [Chokidar](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar).

## Installation

Supports only **Node.js v8.16 and higher**.

```sh
npm install fsevents
```

## Usage

```js
<<<<<<< HEAD
var fsevents = require('fsevents');
var watcher = fsevents(__dirname);
watcher.on('fsevent', function(path, flags, id) { }); // RAW Event as emitted by OS-X
watcher.on('change', function(path, info) { }); // Common Event for all changes
watcher.start() // To start observation
watcher.stop()  // To end observation
```

### Events

 * *fsevent* - RAW Event as emitted by OS-X
 * *change* - Common Event for all changes
 * *created* - A File-System-Item has been created
 * *deleted* - A File-System-Item has been deleted
 * *modified* - A File-System-Item has been modified
 * *moved-out* - A File-System-Item has been moved away from this location
 * *moved-in* - A File-System-Item has been moved into this location

All events except *fsevent* take an *info* object as the second parameter of the callback. The structure of this object is:

```js
{
  "event": "<event-type>",
  "id": <eventi-id>,
  "path": "<path-that-this-is-about>",
  "type": "<file|directory|symlink>",
  "changes": {
    "inode": true, // Has the iNode Meta-Information changed
    "finder": false, // Has the Finder Meta-Data changed
    "access": false, // Have the access permissions changed
    "xattrs": false // Have the xAttributes changed
  },
  "flags": <raw-flags>
}
```

const fsevents = require('fsevents');
const stop = fsevents.watch(__dirname, (path, flags, id) => {
  const info = fsevents.getInfo(path, flags, id);
}); // To start observation
stop(); // To end observation
```

The callback passed as the second parameter to `.watch` get's called whenever the operating system detects a
a change in the file system. It takes three arguments:

###### `fsevents.watch(dirname: string, (path: string, flags: number, id: string) => void): () => Promise<undefined>`

 * `path: string` - the item in the filesystem that have been changed
 * `flags: number` - a numeric value describing what the change was
 * `id: string` - an unique-id identifying this specific event

 Returns closer callback which when called returns a Promise resolving when the watcher process has been shut down.

###### `fsevents.getInfo(path: string, flags: number, id: string): FsEventInfo`

The `getInfo` function takes the `path`, `flags` and `id` arguments and converts those parameters into a structure
that is easier to digest to determine what the change was.

The `FsEventsInfo` has the following shape:

```js
/**
 * @typedef {'created'|'modified'|'deleted'|'moved'|'root-changed'|'cloned'|'unknown'} FsEventsEvent
 * @typedef {'file'|'directory'|'symlink'} FsEventsType
 */
{
  "event": "created", // {FsEventsEvent}
  "path": "file.txt",
  "type": "file",    // {FsEventsType}
  "changes": {
    "inode": true,   // Had iNode Meta-Information changed
    "finder": false, // Had Finder Meta-Data changed
    "access": false, // Had access permissions changed
    "xattrs": false  // Had xAttributes changed
  },
  "flags": 0x100000000
}
```

## Changelog

- v2.3 supports Apple Silicon ARM CPUs
- v2 supports node 8.16+ and reduces package size massively
- v1.2.8 supports node 6+
- v1.2.7 supports node 4+

## Troubleshooting

- I'm getting `EBADPLATFORM` `Unsupported platform for fsevents` error.
- It's fine, nothing is broken. fsevents is macos-only. Other platforms are skipped. If you want to hide this warning, report a bug to NPM bugtracker asking them to hide ebadplatform warnings by default.
